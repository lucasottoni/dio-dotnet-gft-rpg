# dio-dotnet-gft-rpg

RPG DIO Project.
The goal of this project is learning about Object Oriented programming.

The project was made to achieve the project for GFT at DIO.

There will be some Heroes classes implemented as Entities:
 - Knight
 - Ninja
 - White Wizard
 - Black Wizard

Those heroes can do a basic attack or a bonus attack.
Each class has their max mana and health. And the attack do damage to the enemy base on the classe and how much mana has been spent at the attack.
